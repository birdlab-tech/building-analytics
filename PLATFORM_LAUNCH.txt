Can use console at:
https://cloud.digitalocean.com
(log in using GitHub credentials)

Or PowerShell tab with:
ssh root@167.172.54.56


Proper recovery script:
ssh root@167.172.54.56 "bash /opt/bms-analytics/recovery.sh"


Also read or get Claude Code to read:

CLAUDE_PROTOCOL.md
CLAUDE_STARTUP_GUIDE.md
CRASH_RECOVERY.md

In C:\Users\ahami\OneDrive\Documents\KCL PhD\ResearchProposal\Independent Building Analytics


Is actually nicer to work in PowerShell tab than the Digital Ocean console (for copying/pasting etc) but works best when command lines in this format:

ssh root@167.172.54.56 "xxx"
